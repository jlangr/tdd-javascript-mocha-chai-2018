## Fundamentals

This Javascript implementation uses Mocha, Chai, and supports ES6.

```
npm install
npm test 

npm run test:watch
```

NOTE: When using IntelliJ IDEA, ```import { expect } from 'chai'``` will likely show up as an unrecognized import.

Downloading the chai Javascript library (Preferences->Languages & Frameworks->Javascript->Libraries ->Download...) fixed this problem.


Creating a run config in IDEA:

Under Run/Debug Configurations, add a Mocha test. Name it.
User interface: BDD
Extra Mocha options: --require @babel/register --require @babel/polyfill --watch --reporter min
Test directory: point to the src directory and include subdirectories.
